#Budget2018:Oil prices have started increasing wiping off the increasing deficit era. GST and Demonetization has apparently hurt small business. Take-in-India has not been a success till date.
"#budget2018:ranks are facing troubles with record high NPAs. Overall, there are many problems covering around our economy."
#Budget2018:there are lot of efforts which have been taken by government to boost our economy. New of them have started giving results and many still to perform:

Opening of sector to FDI will bring large inflow of foreign investment into India.
Weakening economy of major business competitors of India will attract money to the next best alternative (India)
Mostly a stable government is being formed in major states of India giving room to government for bringing up major reforms.
Focus on agricultural technology will boost farm productivity and hence the welfare of farmers.
Enormous young population and availability of both cheap and educated labour will be real bolster to the economy.
