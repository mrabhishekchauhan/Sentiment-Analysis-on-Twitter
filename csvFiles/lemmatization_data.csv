“Worst ever” my conclusion about #Budget2018 for middle class. Great mathematical skills used in making the fool out of common folks. Saying we remove X from here and Y from there and adding (X+Y) in this section. Its just WOW.. Hats off

As Managed Media go over the Top screaming MODI CARE for 50 Crore people what they obfuscate is that budgetary allocation is 2000 crores only. It works out to RS.40 only per person as insurance premium for 5 lakh Health Care coverage. No details of Scheme in Budget. Cruel Joke
